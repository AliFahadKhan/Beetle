## Final Year Project 2021 - 2022

###### Abstract
Digital agriculture is on the rise throughout the world, aided by many new innovations in the fields of machine learning, internet of things, and computer vision. Alongside this, ecommerce, which has been now accepted by the world and is here to stay, is facing a major change with the growth of specialized marketplaces in place of generalized marketplaces like Amazon.

The aim of this project is to build a fully sustainable agricultural platform that provides crop advisory mobile/webbased services facilitated by a discussion forum and integrated with a B2c ecommerce platform. Every aspect of the app is built while keeping in view the requirements of Pakistan's major crops and local farmers.

There are three major components of the project:

• Crop advisory through machine learning models:

    − Disease detection models for some of the major crops grown in Pakistan.

    − The modules provide insight into several different problems that the crop may be facing and suggestactions to take against them.

• A discussion forum platform:

    − A discussion forum platform customized for the farmers of Pakistan where they can discuss and help each other with the problems that they face regarding their crops and agricultural activities.

• A specialized B2C ecommerce platform:

    − Allow businesses to setup their stores to sell agricultural utilities including but not limited to tools, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc.

The three modules promote each other among potential users. This is done by connecting the three in 
our use cases. An example would be a case in which a farmer would use our crop advisory to identify a problem. The app 
would then suggest some product to overcome the problem. Any instances of this product, if available on the 
ecommerce platform, would then be automatically marketed to the user. If the users are unsure of anything or are not 
satisfied, they can discuss further with other farmers and agricultural experts by browsing through or creating new 
forums.
